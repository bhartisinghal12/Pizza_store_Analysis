## 🍕 Pizza Store Sales Analysis — SQL Case Study

This project is a **SQL-based data analysis** of a fictional pizza store. It explores various business questions related to sales, revenue, and customer ordering patterns. The dataset mimics a real-world food delivery business, containing tables like `orders`, `order_details`, `pizzas`, and `pizza_types`.

### 📊 Objectives

The aim is to extract actionable insights from the pizza store’s sales data. Key questions answered:

* Which pizza types generate the most **revenue**?
* What are the **top-selling** pizzas by quantity?
* What is the **average number of pizzas ordered per day**?
* What **percentage of revenue** does each pizza category contribute?
* How do different **pizza sizes** perform?
* What are the **peak order days**?

---

### 🔎 Key Insights

* **Top 3 Revenue-Generating Pizza Types** identified.
* Classic category contributes the **highest revenue share**.
* Medium-sized pizzas are the **most ordered size**.
* Sales trend shows peak ordering during weekends.

---

### 🧰 Tools & Skills Used

* **SQL (MySQL)** for data querying and aggregation
* **Joins**, **GROUP BY**, **aggregate functions** (`SUM`, `AVG`, `ROUND`)
* **Subqueries** and **nested SELECTs**
* Performance optimization using **aliasing** and **ordering**

---
